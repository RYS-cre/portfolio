                overview={`SigmaVUE is a real-time trading terminal that lets retail and enterprise users automate trades, copy trades across multiple brokerage accounts, and monitor performance with low latency. When I joined, the product had powerful ideas and a basic Next.js app  but struggled with frontend reliability (flaky WebSockets), slow initial renders on the dashboard, and inconsistent data handling (e.g., poor session and auth management, broken hooks, inconsistent data conventions). My mandate was to make the experience fast, resilient, and trustworthyâ€”and to ship features that could scale to enterprise customers.

                    I led the frontend architecture in Next.js + TypeScript, built a robust data layer with TanStack Query for server state and Zustand for local/UI state, and standardized component patterns with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI. On the data side, the backend team built a django app that (on GCP Kubernetes) emits position_update events for opens/closes/changes, while a separate quote stream feeds live prices. I designed a FE pipeline that computes PnL client-side from that quote stream, avoiding backend hot paths and keeping the UI reactive under load. For reliability, I implemented idempotent WS handlers, exponential backoff, automatic resubscription, and thoughtful empty/error/skeleton states to keep the app stable and legible even under poor network conditions.`}
